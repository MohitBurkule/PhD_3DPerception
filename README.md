## UKRAS : Determining shape of strawberry crops with spherical harmonics

We present our UKRAS 2020 paper in the folder called UKRAS. You can find there the PDF for the paper and some code presented as a jupyter notebook, to try and reproduce the paper. Following the jupyter notebok let you learn about how to open and process the point cloud, compute forward spherical harmonics transform, reconstruct and plot the obtained coefficients.
